### Welcome to my C++ Pool repository üëã

‚≠êÔ∏è The C++ Pool is composed of 9 modules :
- module00: Namespace, class, member functions, stdio stream, initialization lists, static, const, and lots of basic stuff
- module01: Memory allocation, References, Pointers to members, File streams
- module02: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overload and canonical classes
